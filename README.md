## Language Identification System

### Overview
This project focuses on building a language identification system which can accurately detect the language of a given text input. By using machine learning techniques such as Multinomial Naive Bayes, the system achieves high accuracy and can be applied in areas like translation tools, chatbots, and search engines. 

### Features
- Supports multiple languages, including English, French, Hindi, Spanish, German, and more.
- High accuracy (94.7%)
- Handles short text inputs and mixed-language scenarios.
- Easy to integrate into various applications.

### Prerequisites
To run the project, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

You can install these dependencies using the command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
