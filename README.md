## Language Identification System

### Overview
This project focuses on building a language identification system which can accurately detect the language of a given text input. By using machine learning techniques such as Multinomial Naive Bayes, the system achieves high accuracy and can be applied in areas like translation tools, chatbots, and search engines. 

### Features
- Supports multiple languages, including English, French, Hindi, Spanish, German, and more.
- High accuracy (94.7%)
- Handles short text inputs and mixed-language scenarios.
- Easy to integrate into various applications.

### Prerequisites
To run the project, ensure you have the following:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Required libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

You can install these dependencies using the command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```
### Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains approximately 10,000 samples of text in 17 different languages. Each sample includes the text and its corresponding language label.

**Dataset Link:** [Language Detection Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhamjnv770/language-detection)

### Steps to Download the Dataset
1. Visit the dataset link above.
2. Download the dataset as a `.csv` file.
3. Save the dataset in the project directory under a folder named `data`.
4. Rename the file to `language-detection.csv`.

### How to Run the System

Follow these steps to run the language identification system:

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL
```
#### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
```bash
cd language-identification-system
```
#### Step 3: Load the Dataset
Ensure the dataset (language-detection.csv) is placed in the data folder.
#### Step 4: Run the Script
Execute the main script to train the model and test predictions:
```bash
python scripts/main.py
```
#### Step 5: Predict a Language
You can input a custom text to predict its language. Modify the predict function in the script:
```python
text = "Pickleball" # Example input
print(predict(text))
```
### Implementation Details

#### Data Preprocessing
- **Cleaning**
- **Vectorization**
- **Label Encoding**
- **Splitting**

#### Machine Learning Model
We use the Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) classifier for text classification tasks. The model is trained on vectorized data and evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

#### Future Improvements
- **Expand Language Support:** Add more languages to the dataset.
- **Enhance Preprocessing:** Include techniques like stemming.
- **Experiment with Advanced Models:** Try Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.
- **Handle Mixed-language Texts:** Improve the modelâ€™s ability to classify multilingual inputs.
